		<p><font color="blue"><b><h4>Mision</h4>The mission of Kalyani Government Engineering College is to impart quality technical education to the students at the undergraduate and at the postgraduate levels of engineering with the aim to make them complete human beings possessing depth of knowledge not only in their own discipline but also in the kindred areas, which shall necessarily be accompanied by a wide mental horizon making them capable of sifting the grain from the chaff, the honesty from the chicanery, the truth from the untruth.</font></p>
		<p><font color="blue">
		<h4>Vision</h4>
		The vision of Kalyani Government Engineering College is to produce high quality, globally competitive technical manpower and to become a centre of excellence in a few select areas of high-end technologies. It also envisages to act as an incubation cell for entrepreneurship activities in the region in association with the industry houses of the locality and outside. Keeping pace with the global technological developments through continuing education programmes is its another cherished ambition.</b></font></p>
		<p><font color="blue"><h4>IQAC</h4>In pursuance of the National Action Plan of the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), Bangalore, for performance evaluation, assessment, accreditation and quality up-gradation of Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs), the NAAC proposes that every accredited institution establish an Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) as a post-accreditation quality sustenance measure. The University Grants Commission (UGC), India has (in the XI Plan) made a policy decision to direct all HEIs to establish IQAC. Since quality enhancement is a continuous process, the IQAC will become a part of the institution and work towards realizing the goals of quality enhancement and sustenance. The prime task of the IQAC is to develop a system for conscious, consistent and catalytic improvement in the performance of institutions. The IQAC will make a significant and meaningful contribution in the post-accreditation phase of institutions. During the post-accreditation period, the IQAC will channelize the efforts and measures of an institution towards academic excellence. The IQAC is the nodal agency entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring total quality management by ushering in innovations leading to achieving excellence and adoption of intervention strategies for monitoring their successful implementation. Ever in quest for excellence, the IQAC functions to assure institutional accountability with probity to all the stakeholders, funding agencies in particular and society as a whole. </font></p>
